# Engineering Estate Dashboard

Welcome to the org-wide view for the `frasermolyneux` tenant. This GitHub Pages site mirrors the content in the repository so you can browse pipelines and dependencies without opening individual repos.

- [Route to Production](estate/route-to-production.md) — live release badges for every managed repository.
- [Workload Catalog](estate/workloads.md) — workloads, environments, and subscriptions sourced from `platform-workloads` JSON.
- [Visualizations](estate/visualizations.md) — dependency sketches; will be generated from workload metadata.
- [Automation Plan](estate/automation.md) — how we keep these pages fresh (GitHub + Azure DevOps APIs).

> Tip: Bookmark this page; badges stay live, so failing pipelines surface here first.
